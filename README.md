**Nakamti** (Oromo: Naqamtee; also called Nekemt) is a market town and separate 
woreda in western Ethiopia.

It's also a coffee discovery service, utilizing REST and GraphQL to provide 
geolocation services for intelligent coffee discovery. It understands coffee
varieties and events, and is connected to the coffee community. 

## History

This is the 4th generation of this service. 

 - The first was written in Java 8 in 2011 / 2012.
 - The second was written in Node.js / JavaScript in 2012 / 2013.
 - The third was written in a mixture of Go and Python (utilizing TensorFlow) in 2013 - 2015.
  
The active repository for the latest iteration is housed privately 
with a significant delay between the private development efforts
and this public mirror, and is actively running concurrently with 
the third iteration across different projects.
